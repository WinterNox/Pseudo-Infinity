# Pseudo-Infinity
A PewPew Live level code that describes how to create a level that loops around, generating a pseudo-infinite effect as seen in 'Asteroids', a level in the game.
# Personal Use
Feel free to use this for your own level. You need to have your entity spawn coordinates in a different manner than usual. That manner has been demonstrated in level.lua of 'Pseudo-Infinity'. It should be pretty easy to grasp.
## Pros and Cons
Pros:
- It's infinite.
- It's smooth.

Cons:
- It flickers at the transition moment.
- Things like the trail of the player reset at the transition.
